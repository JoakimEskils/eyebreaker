# eyebreaker

This is an extension which can be found in Visual Studio Code.

Eyebreaker sets a timer for 20 minutes and  will notify you with a warning message after the 20 minute countdown. This is a reminder for you to look away from the screen temporarily for a minute or two to prevent straining the eyes and other health issues.
